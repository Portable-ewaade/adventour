                     <p>The Esa cave which is located in Iyin Ekiti has an age long history of having been the safe harbor for the Iyin and Ado-Ekiti warriors during the inter-township fight with the Ikere-Ekiti people of Ekiti state.The warriors and the people would run to the cave for safety till the land is restored back to normalcy. On the long run many of the people decided to stay back and live in the cave instead than running about anytime there is a war. Gradually a lot of Iyin Ekiti people abandoned their main town and started living in the cave till about the 1930’s when few of them begin to return back to their town.
