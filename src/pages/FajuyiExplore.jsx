                <h4>History</h4>
                <p> Fajuyi Memorial Park is a significant historical site located in Ado-Ekiti, the capital city of Ekiti State, Nigeria. The park is named in honor of Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi, a Nigerian military officer who served as the military governor of the Western Region of Nigeria in the 1960s. Colonel Fajuyi played a prominent role in Nigeria's history, particularly during the military coup of 1966. On July 29, 1966, a group of army officers led by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu staged a coup, which resulted in the assassination of the Nigerian Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, and several other high-ranking government officials. In response, Colonel Fajuyi, who was then the military governor of the Western Region, demonstrated loyalty to the federal government by refusing to abandon the Prime Minister and other officials who were taken into custody.
                </p>

                 <p>Tragically, as a result of his loyalty, Colonel Fajuyi was also killed during the coup. His death made him a symbol of sacrifice and patriotism in Nigeria's history. Fajuyi Memorial Park was established as a tribute to his memory and the ideals he represented.
                 </p>
                 <p>The park serves as a memorial site and a recreational area for visitors. It features a cenotaph, which is a monument erected in honor of Colonel Fajuyi and other fallen heroes. The park also includes green spaces, walkways, and seating areas where people can relax and enjoy the serene environment.
                 </p>
                 <p>Fajuyi Memorial Park is not only a reminder of the sacrifice made by Colonel Fajuyi but also a place that promotes reflection on Nigeria's history and the values of patriotism and selflessness</p>
