According to the people of erijiyan, the river is the source of the town, the guardian that protects their children wherever they reside on earth and it is capable of solving numerous problems and challenges affecting man. Even the name, erijiyan, was coined from the name of the river, “Erin”. Erijiyan translates to “Erin river does not argue,” which is the reason the river is located where it is today. 
                     </p>
    
                     <p>According to the mythology of the people, a strange woman who migrated to the town turned into the river and the fish are her children. Hence, it is a taboo to kill the fish and even if this is done, the fish will never get cooked however long one tries.
